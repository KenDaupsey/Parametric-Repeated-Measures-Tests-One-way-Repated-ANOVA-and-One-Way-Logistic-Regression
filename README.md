# Parametric Repeated Measures Analysis

This repository explores the application of parametric statistical tests for repeated measures data, including:

- One-way repeated measures ANOVA 
- Repeated measures logistic regression

## Contents

The analysis covers:

- Importing and wrangling repeated measures data in Python
- Implementing one-way RM ANOVA using the `statsmodels` library 
- Interpreting ANOVA results and significance testing
- Fitting repeated measures logistic regression models with `statsmodels`
- Understanding model coefficients and random effects
- Comparing tests for different research questions
  
## Datasets

The analysis utilizes two datasets:

- [Oneway Repeated Measures ANOVA~rb4.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KenDaupsey/One-Way-Repeated-measures-ANOVA/main/Oneway%20Repeated%20Measures%20ANOVA%7Erb4.csv): For one-way RM ANOVA
- [LogisticMeasures~LogisticRegression~~Exrecise.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KenDaupsey/logistic-regression-python/main/LogisticMeasures%7ELogisticRegression%7E%7EExrecise.csv): For logistic regression 

## Usage

The README serves as documentation for the analysis. The Python code can be adapted and applied to other repeated measures datasets.
